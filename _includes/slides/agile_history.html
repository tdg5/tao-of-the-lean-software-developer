    <h3>A brief history of Agile</h3>
    <p>
       The idea of agile software development devolved from dissatisfaction with
       the widely used waterfall model of the 1980s and 90s. Recognizing
       waterfall methodologyâ€™s inefficiencies, developers reconsidered and
       reinvented the product development life cycle.

    <h3>A brief history of Agile</h3>
    <p>
      In February of 2001, a number of software developers from all over the
      U.S. assembled at a Utah ski resort to philosophize on the merits of
      leaner development strategies.

    <p>
      With the Manifesto for Agile Software
      Development, they developed standards that have forever transformed the
      software development landscape.

    <h3>Tenets of the Agile Manifesto</h3>
    <p>
      We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and
      helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div>
        <strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
      items on the left more.
